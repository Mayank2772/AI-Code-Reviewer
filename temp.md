❌ Bad Code:
```python
print('Hello')
```

🔍 Issues:
* ❌ While technically correct, the code lacks context. It's unclear what the purpose of printing "Hello" is without
additional information.

✅ Recommended Fix:

```python
def greet(name):
"""
Prints a personalized greeting to the console.
Args:
name (str): The name of the person to greet.
"""
print(f"Hello, {name}!")

greet("World")
```

💡 Improvements:

* ✔️ Added a function to encapsulate the print statement, making it reusable.
* ✔️ Included a docstring to explain the function's purpose.
* ✔️ Used an f-string to create a personalized greeting, improving flexibility.
* ✔️ Changed the argument from static 'Hello' to dynamic 'World' to reflect a simple improvement.

Final Note:

Even seemingly simple code can benefit from improvements in structure, documentation, and flexibility. Always aim for
code that is not only correct but also maintainable and understandable.
